        <h1>Disclaimer for MyFedPension</h1>

        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MyFedPension (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is an application designed to estimate pension values and provide visual tools, such as graphs and sliders, for easier understanding. These estimates are tailored specifically for immediate annuity calculations under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This app focuses only on immediate annuity calculations. It does not cover other retirement types, such as early, disability, deferred, or phased retirement.</li>
            <li>By using this application, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this disclaimer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Non-Official Tool</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent Application: MyFedPension is an independent tool created by an individual developer and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any government agency or official organization.</li>
            <li>Interpretation of Rules: This app interprets the general guidelines and principles related to FERS pensions to provide estimations and visualizations. It is not an official resource and should not be considered as such.</li>
            <li>Calculation Methods: Any explanations of FERS pension calculations provided in the app are simplified interpretations of complex federal regulations. Users should refer to official OPM documentation for complete and authoritative information about pension calculation methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. No Professional Financial or Legal Advice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Informational Purpose Only: The information and calculations provided by MyFedPension are for general informational purposes only. They are not intended to replace professional financial, legal, or retirement advice.</li>
            <li>Consult Professionals: Users are strongly encouraged to consult with qualified financial advisors, legal professionals, or their human resources representatives for personalized advice regarding their specific retirement planning and pension details.</li>
            <li>Verification Required: Users approaching retirement eligibility should verify all calculations and eligibility determinations with their agency's human resources department. Retirement decisions should not be made solely based on this app's calculations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Estimated Calculations: MyFedPension provides estimated pension values and eligibility dates based on the information entered. While the app strives for accurate estimates, we do not guarantee that these estimates reflect your actual pension benefits or eligibility status. Additionally, various factors not accounted for in this app may influence your actual pension outcomes.</li>
            <li>Special Category Employment: While MyFedPension includes calculations for special category employees (such as law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers), these calculations are estimates only and may not reflect all specific circumstances or special provisions that might apply to individual cases.</li>
            <li>No Warranty: We make no warranties or representations regarding the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the app’s calculations for any purpose. All information is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind.</li>

            <li>Non-Personalized Ads: MyFedPension currently does not display advertisements. However, if advertisements are integrated in the future, the app will prioritize serving non-personalized ads. These ads are not tailored to individual users and are based on general app context.</li>
            <li>Data Sharing for Ads: Third-party ad services, such as Google AdMob, may process limited information (e.g., IP address, general device data) required to display ads. This information is not used to track users or build personalized profiles.</li>
