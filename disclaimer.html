        <ul>
            <li>MyFedPension (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is an application designed to estimate pension values and provide visual tools, such as graphs and sliders, for easier understanding. These estimates are tailored specifically for immediate annuity calculations under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This app focuses only on immediate annuity calculations. It does not cover other retirement types, such as early, disability, deferred, or phased retirement. By using this application, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this disclaimer.</li>
